## Code navigation

1. Navigate to the last edited location: <br />
   command + shift + back space <br />
   If keep pressing, it will navigate progressively to the last edited locations
   
2. Navigate between matching braces: <br />
   control + M <br />
   Example: python_dict = {'k1': 'val1'}: use this shortcut to move the cursor (caret) located at one of the curly braces to the other one back and forth
