## Code navigation

1. **Navigate to the last edited location**: <br />
   command + shift + back space <br />
   If keep pressing, it will navigate progressively to the last edited locations
   
2. **Navigate between matching braces**: <br />
   control + M <br />
   Example: ```python_dict = {'k1': 'val1'}```: use this shortcut to move the cursor (caret) located at one of the curly braces to the other one back and forth

## Line manipulation

1. **Add new line after the current line** <br />
   shift + enter <br />

2. **Add new line before the current line** <br />
   option + command + enter <br />

3. **Duplicate line or selection** <br />
   shift + enter <br />
   If the cursor is positioned at any character of the line, then it would duplicate the line, the new line is created under the duplicated line and the cursor is positioned at the same character in the new line <br /> 
   If something is selected then it would duplicate the selection, the duplication would start at the last character of the selection and the cursor would be positioned at the last character of the duplication

4. **Delete current line/ multiple selected lines** <br />
   command + back space <br />
   If cursor positioned at line or the line/multiple lines is selected partially or totally, this shortcut works

5. **Move current line/ multiple selected lines** <br />
   option + shift + arrows(up/down) <br />
   If cursor positioned at line or the line/multiple lines is selected partially or totally, this shortcut works
